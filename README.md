### Happy to meet you! :)

Passionate about computers since I was young, I learned on my own and also through my studies to design websites, applications, manage databases and find security holes in a system or a website.

Having grown up in a connected world, I could see how important computer security was for our country, but also for companies and the world around us.

I am currently in my first year of engineering school in cybersecurity :)
